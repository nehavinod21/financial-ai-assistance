Got it! Here is the updated version of the README with the additional section about where to run the program:
# Financial Tracker Assistant

### Overview
The Financial Tracker Assistant is an interactive Python-based application designed to help users track their income, expenses, and savings. It also provides personalized saving tips and allows users to visualize their spending by category. The tool is powered by natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users in a conversational way, providing an enhanced user experience.

### Features
- **Track Income and Expenses**: View total income, total expenses, and savings.
- **Summarize Spending by Category**: See how much you spend in various categories like food, entertainment, etc.
- **Visualize Spending**: Generate bar charts to visualize spending across different categories.
- **Add New Expense**: Easily input new expenses into the system.
- **Saving Tips**: Get personalized tips to help you save money.
- **Expense Queries**: Ask about specific spending categories to track how much you've spent.
- **AI Assistant**: An interactive assistant that answers financial questions and offers saving tips.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - spacy
  - os
  - random

### Installation
1. **Install the required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib spacy
   ```

2. **Download the Spacy model**:

   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Set up your CSV file**:
   Ensure that your CSV file (`transactions_converted.csv`) is properly formatted with the following columns:
   - Category: The category of the expense (e.g., 'Food', 'Entertainment').
   - Amount: The amount spent or earned.
   - Type: Either 'Income' or 'Expense'.

4. **Place the CSV file in the correct directory**:
   Make sure your CSV file is in the path defined in the code (e.g., `file_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/transactions_converted.csv"`), or change the file path in the code to match your location.

### Where to Run the Program

1. **Local Machine**:
   - You can run this program directly on your local computer if you have Python installed.
   - Navigate to the folder where the `financial_tracker.py` file and the `transactions_converted.csv` file are stored using the terminal or command prompt.
   
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   python financial_tracker.py
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   - In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where your files are located, then create and activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   After activation, install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

   Then run the program as mentioned earlier:
   ```bash
   python financial_tracker.py
   ```

### Usage
To run the program:
1. Execute the Python script `financial_tracker.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen menu and interact with the assistant to:
   - View spending summaries.
   - Add new expenses.
   - Get personalized saving tips.
   - Visualize spending by category.
   - Ask the AI assistant questions about your finances.

#### Example Queries for the AI Assistant:
- "How much did I spend on food last month?"
- "Give me some tips to save money."
- "What are my total savings?"

### Code Walkthrough
1. **Loading and Checking Data**: The application begins by checking if the CSV file exists and loads the transaction data.
2. **Summarizing Data**: Users can view their total income, total expenses, and calculate their savings.
3. **Data Visualization**: Spending across categories is visualized in a bar chart for a more intuitive understanding of finances.
4. **NLP Integration**: The AI assistant uses the Spacy NLP model to understand user queries related to expenses and savings. It offers personalized tips and can help track specific expenses.
